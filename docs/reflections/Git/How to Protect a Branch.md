# How to Protect a Branch

If you are using Gitlab as I am now,

Go to 1. Settings

then 2. /repository

Expand 3. Protected branches

Protect your branch.

I suggest, for master branch, put `Allowed to merge` to `maintainers`; `Allowed to push` to `No one`. And of course disable force push; Code owner approval should be left on.

# Remake Your Project Folder

Sometimes you want to delete all the temp folders, node_modules and have a clean project folder, like it was freshly downloaded from the git server.

```Bash
git clean -xfd
```

Delete untracked files and directories from the working tree. 

Perfect to ensure a clean environment for a fresh build.

# Parse and Generation

A segment of code is essentially a string of characters.

To run a string, usually we first break it into tokens, then parse the tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST), and finally generate the code from the AST.

That's sth I have made a demo before. It's still in my repo. That toy project can

- parse a string into tokens
- parse tokens into AST
- execute the AST

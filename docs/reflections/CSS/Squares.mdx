# Squares

sometimes you need to determine the height of an element based on its width. This is a common use case for images, but it can be used for any element.

```html
<div style={{ width: "100px", position: "relative" }}>
  <div
    style={{
      paddingBottom: "100%",
      position: "relative",
    }}
  >
    <img
      src="https://via.placeholder.com/150"
      style={{ position: "absolute", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

<div style={{ width: "100px", position: "relative" }}>
  <div
    style={{
      paddingBottom: "100%",
      position: "relative",
    }}
  >
    <img
      src="https://via.placeholder.com/150"
      style={{ position: "absolute", width: "100%", height: "100%" }}
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Explanation

The outer div is the container, and the inner div is the aspect ratio container. The aspect ratio container is a square because the `padding-bottom` is set to `100%`. The image is absolutely positioned inside the aspect ratio container and set to `width: 100%` and `height: 100%`. This makes the image fill the aspect ratio container while maintaining the aspect ratio of the image.

# About Webauthn

Webauthn is a new standard for secure authentication on the web. It allows users to authenticate to web applications using public key cryptography instead of a password. This is more secure and convenient than traditional password-based authentication.

`SPKAC`: Signed Public Key and Challenge

`U2F`: Universal 2nd Factor

`FIDO`: Fast Identity Online, an alliance of companies that developed the Webauthn standard. Their goal is to reduce the world's reliance on passwords.

Personally, I am happy Muggles are finally getting a taste of the magic of public key cryptography. It's about time. I am not going to exam the details of Webauthn, but I will show you a door [webauthn.guide](https://webauthn.guide/).

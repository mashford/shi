learned a new word `Cannibalization`. like `cannibalization between`, `cannibalize one unit for the sake of another of the same kind`.

for SEO improvements:

[Canonical URL](https://juejin.cn/post/7241813423460581435?searchId=202401251434030E1C5A2E47BAB489CCA5)

when we have two urls for similar content, the two URLs will compete in the page-ranking algorithm. Thus, both have low score.

We need to tell google crawler to seem them as the same page.

```html
<head>
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://juejin.cn" />
</head>
```

for example https://shopee.sg/list/Phone and https://shopee.sg/search?keyword=phone are the same.

### How to have better page loading experience

`start render time` is the moment something first displays on the userâ€™s screen.

Human-computer interaction (HCI) guidelines recommend a 1-2 second start render time.

see [link](https://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/start-render/)

What is FCP?
The First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric measures the time from when the user first navigated to the page to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen. For this metric, "content" refers to text, images (including background images), `<svg>` elements, or non-white `<canvas>` elements.

### schema

you may wonder how some pages shows extra infos. that's because they specify schema.

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
  {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
    "itemListElement": [
      {
        "item": { "@id": "https://www.lazada.sg", "name": "Home" },
        "@type": "ListItem",
        "position": 1
      },
      {
        "item": {
          "@id": "https://www.lazada.sgurl",
          "name": "Mobiles & Tablets"
        },
        "@type": "ListItem",
        "position": 2
      },
      {
        "item": { "@id": "https://www.lazada.sgurl", "name": "Smartphones" },
        "@type": "ListItem",
        "position": 3
      }
    ]
  }
</script>
```

I am currently using nvm, node version manager. And as I am maintaining many projects, I found I am busy switching node and pnpm versions like blow:

```zsh
node -v
nvm use node 18.19.0

corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@8.11.0 --activate
```

Considering I need to do it multiple times a day, an automation tool becomes a necessity. So I searched and the only answer seems to be [Volta](https://volta.sh/).

I like the `volta pin` function, it pins a volta setting in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "volta": {
    "node": "16.19.1",
    "pnpm": "8.11.0 "
  }
}
```

Next time you enter the folder, volta will change your node version and pnpm version automatically.

The only concern about volta, is that it seems to be built for npm / yarn. Who's not using pnpm these days? But Volta only has limited support for pnpm. https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/737
